# Clock-Synchronyzer
Distributed Clock Synchronyzer written in GoLang.

Building a clock synchronization protocol can be a challenging yet rewarding project. Here's a roadmap to get you started:

**Step 1: Understanding existing protocols:**

* **Start by thoroughly researching protocols like NTP (Network Time Protocol) and PTP (Precision Time Protocol).** Understand their strengths, weaknesses, message formats, and how they handle factors like network delays and clock drift.
* **Consider additional protocols like FTSP (Flooding-Time Synchronization Protocol) or PulseSync** for inspiration depending on your desired network size and complexity.

**Step 2: Design your protocol:**

* **Define your target use case:** Consider factors like desired accuracy, network size, resource constraints, and security requirements.
* **Choose a synchronization approach:** Will you use a hierarchical model like NTP with a master and clients, or a peer-to-peer approach like PulseSync?
* **Design your message format:** Define the information exchanged between nodes (timestamps, offsets, delays) and ensure efficient communication.
* **Implement mechanisms to handle network delays and clock drift:** Estimate delays through message exchange times and compensate for clock drift using algorithms like Kalman filters.
* **Consider security aspects:** Implement authentication and encryption to protect against malicious attacks.

**Step 3: Development and testing:**

* **Choose a suitable programming language:** C/C++ are popular choices for performance-critical systems, while Python offers rapid development.
* **Select libraries or frameworks:** Consider libraries like PTPd for PTP implementation or existing NTP libraries as a starting point.
* **Develop a testing framework:** Simulate different network conditions and clock drifts to assess your protocol's performance and accuracy.
* **Measure and analyze results:** Compare your protocol's performance with established protocols and identify areas for improvement.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Programming Language:** C/C++, Python, Java (based on your preferences and expertise)
* **Libraries:** PTPd (PTP implementation), NTP libraries (as reference), network libraries (e.g., Socket programming)
* **Testing Tools:** Network simulators (e.g., Mininet), clock drift simulation tools, performance analysis tools
